/*  Hi Users,
I have created an app that shows Upcoming Movies,

To Run This App In AndroidStudio/Vs.code/any framework,
You need to type  " Flutter run project_moviesapp",
And it will Run on the Web/Emulator...

For getting all the upcoming movies, here I have used "TMBD" api, that is abvailable on google.
We can check trending movie, toprated movies , and many more with TMBD api.


Thanks, and enjoy the app
